Synopsis
========
A number of vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenVPN that were fixed
in the 2.0.1 release.

Background
==========
OpenVPN is a full-featured SSL VPN solution which can accomodate a wide
range of configurations.

Description
===========

CAN-2005-2531:
DoS attack against server when run with "verb 0" and without "tls-auth".
If a client connection to the server fails certificate verification,
the OpenSSL error queue is not properly flushed, which can result in
another unrelated client instance on the server seeing the error and
responding to it, resulting in disconnection of the unrelated client.

CAN-2005-2532:
DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
This bug presents a potential DoS attack vector against the server which
can only be initiated by a connected and authenticated client. If the
client sends a packet which fails to decrypt on the server, the OpenSSL
error queue is not properly flushed, which can result in another
unrelated client instance on the server seeing the error and responding
to it, resulting in disconnection of the unrelated client.

CAN-2005-2533:
DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
A malicious client in "dev tap" ethernet bridging mode could
theoretically flood the server with packets appearing to come from
hundreds of thousands of different MAC addresses, causing the OpenVPN
process to deplete system virtual memory as it expands its internal
routing table. A --max-routes-per-client directive has been added
(default=256) to limit the maximum number of routes in OpenVPN's
internal routing table which can be associated with a given client.

CAN-2005-2534
DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
If two or more client machines try to connect to the server at the same
time via TCP, using the same client certificate, and when --duplicate-cn
is not enabled on the server, a race condition can crash the server with
"Assertion failed at mtcp.c:411".

Affected packages
=================
openvpn in devel, test, stable-rc 0.2 and stable 0.1 grimoires is
affected. This is now fixed in all grimoires.

Resolution
==========
All openvpn users should upgrade to the latest available version:
# scribe update
# cast -c openvpn

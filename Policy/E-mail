= Source Mage E-mail Policy =

After you've been provided general developer access to Source Mage infrastructure, you can request e-mail access to be able to send and receive mail from/to your **@sourcemage.org** address:

=== 1. Generate a CSR

{{{
$ openssl genrsa -out <your_id>.key 2048
$ openssl req -new -key <your_id>.key -out <your_id>.csr
}}}

**Note:** {{{CN}}} value must be your ssh/git username.

=== 2. Send a letter with generated CSR attached

The letter must be PGP-signed with your key and sent to the [[Contact/E-mail|project lead's alias]].

=== 3. Receive the certificate and configure your client(s)

You should get a certificate that can be used in POP3 clients like [[https://marlam.de/mpop/|mpop]]:

{{{
$ cat .mpoprc
defaults
tls on
delivery maildir ~/Maildir
account sourcemage
host post.sourcemage.org
tls_fingerprint 61:12:F9:FA:A8:7A:D2:BB:E1:F3:1E:2A:E7:5D:AA:6D:68:6E:1B:56:E2:EE:8B:5B:C2:39:E6:A2:78:0B:4C:0C
auth plain user user
# password must be set but isn't used
password "-"
tls_key_file ~/.mpop/user.key
tls_cert_file ~/.mpop/user.crt
account default : sourcemage
}}}

If the client requires TLS fingerprint setting to bypass self-signed certificate check, you can get it with:

{{{
$ openssl s_client -connect post.sourcemage.org:465 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdin | cut -d= -f2
}}}

**Note:** SMTP client setups vary.

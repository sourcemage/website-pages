= HISTORY =

The **HISTORY** file is used to contain the revision history of the [[Spell|spell]] for all to see: every change that impacts //behavior// gets an entry in **HISTORY**, consisting of one entry head, and a number of entry lines describing the edit in more detail. The format is the common [[http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html|ChangeLog format]]. The permissions are set to the standard 0644.

== Layout ==

Every entry head holds:
* the date
* name of the Guru
* email of the Guru

Every entry line gets:
* a newline
* one tab
* an asterisk
* a space
* optionally the file(s) altered if this clarifies
* description of the edit

Longer lines get wrapped: use one tab and two spaces to line out the lines.

== Examples ==

{{{
2005-01-26[one-space]John Doe[one-space]<john@example.net>
[one-tab]*[one-space]This line is supposed to look like a too long line, so the line gets
[one-tab][two-spaces]wrapped to the next line, not using another asterisk.

2002-10-31[one-space]John Doe[one-space]<john@example.net>
[one-tab]*[one-space]BUILD: modified to use more of default_build from
[one-tab][two-spaces]/var/lib/sorcery/modules/libgrimoire; fixed Bug #1448

2002-10-07[one-space]John Doe[one-space]<john@example.net>
[one-tab]*[one-space]DETAILS, DEPENDS, BUILD: created spell
[newline]
}}}

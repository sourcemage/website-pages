**When did you first start using Linux and why?**\\
Probably around 2010 or so - i've just always been interested in tinkering with
computers and thought i'd try other things than windows out, it was starting to
annoy me ;)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**\\
As my main OS? About 1.5 years now I wanna say\\
For my first time dabbling? I think about 3 years ago!

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**\\
The magic theme, like most people i'm sure :) Plus i'd never tried a source-based
distribution before and was intrigued! (Or did I try Lunar first...)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**\\
I see it growing bigger! Better than the alternative.. We're too hardy to die :)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**\\
Well i'm Conner, from the midwest US... Have a deep love for vintage computers
as well as the Wonderswan handheld console, love obscure linux distros ( clearly ;) )
and tiny laptops (Long live the netbook!!!)
Ruby is my favorite programming language (as of 2023, watch this change..)
Excited to have a degree in software engineering in a few years!

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**\\
Don't give up hope! Our numbers may be few, but we're strong!

Nothing! Source Mage is my first contribution :)

=Contributing to Source Mage=

There are four areas in which you may "belong" for contributing to Source Mage GNU/Linux:

* Unofficial Developer
* Official Developer
* Official Lead
* Official Team Lead

Being an Unofficial Developer is the easiest and least intensive, while the others become progressively more time consuming. Most Official Developers will start out as Unoffical Developers and then either ask or be asked by an Official Team Lead to join the team they feel they'd most enjoy/benefit.

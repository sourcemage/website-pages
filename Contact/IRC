=Contact via Internet Relay Chat (IRC)=

Please note that IRC can be a low-traffic means of communication. There is active discussion periodically, but if asking for help, it could be a while before somebody answers, especially if most of the developers are on their sleepy time. Be patient and aware of [[IRC culture]].
